                    <h2>Missile Man Of India</h2>
                    <p>
                        <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> (15 October 1931 - 27 July 2015) was an Indian
                        aerospace
                        scientist and statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born
                        and raised in
                        Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four
                        decades as a scientist and
                        science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation <b>(DRDO)</b>
                        and Indian Space Research
                        Organisation <b>(ISRO)</b> and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and
                        military missile development
                        efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of
                        ballistic missile
                        and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political
                        role in
                        India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in
                        1974.
                        <br><br>
                        Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling
                        Bharatiya Janata Party and
                        the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President", he
                        returned to his
                        civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient
                        of several prestigious
                        awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.
                        <br><br>
                        While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and
                        died from an apparent
                        cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.

                    <h3>Career as a scientist</h3>
                    <p>
                        This was my first stage, in which I learnt leadership from three great teachers—Dr Vikram
                        Sarabhai, Prof Satish Dhawan
                        and Dr Brahm Prakash. This was the time of learning and acquisition of knowledge for me.
                        <br><br>
                        A P J Abdul Kalam
                        After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical
                        Development
                        Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau,
                        Government of India) as
                        a scientist after becoming a member of the <b>Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS)</b>.
                        He started his career by
                        designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam was
                        also part of the
                        <b>INCOSPAR</b> committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. In 1969,
                        Kalam was transferred to
                        the <b>Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)</b> where he was the project director of
                        India's first <b>Satellite Launch
                            Vehicle (SLV-III)</b> which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit
                        in July 1980; Kalam had first
                        started work on an expandable rocket project independently at <b>DRDO</b> in 1965. In 1969,
                        Kalam received the government's
                        approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.
                        <br><br>

                    <h5>Kalam addresses engineering students at <b>IIT Guwahati</b></h5><br>
                    <p>
                        In 1963 to 1964, he visited <b>NASA's</b> Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard
                        Space Flight Center in
                        Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility. Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an
                        effort to develop
                        the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle <b>(PSLV) and SLV-III projects,</b> both of which proved to
                        be successful.
                        <br><br>
                        Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as
                        the representative of
                        <b>TBRL,</b> even though he had not participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also
                        directed two projects, Project
                        Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the
                        successful <b>SLV</b>
                        programme. Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted
                        secret funds for
                        these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship. Kalam
                        played an integral role
                        convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace projects.
                        His research and
                        educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the
                        government to initiate an
                        advanced missile programme under his directorship. Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist
                        and scientific adviser
                        to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman
                        on a proposal for
                        simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after
                        another. R Venkatraman
                        was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating ₹ 3.88 billion for the mission,
                        named <b>Integrated Guided
                            Missile Development Programme (IGMDP)</b> and appointed Kalam as the chief executive. Kalam
                        played a major part in
                        developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic
                        missile and Prithvi, the
                        tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticised for
                        mismanagement and cost and time
                        overruns.
                        <br><br>
                        Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence
                        Research and Development
                        Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during
                        this period in which he
                        played an intensive political and technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project
                        Coordinator, along with
                        Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing phase. Media coverage of Kalam during this period
                        made him the
                        country's best known nuclear scientist. However, the director of the site test, K Santhanam,
                        said that the
                        thermonuclear bomb had been a "fizzle" and criticised Kalam for issuing an incorrect report.
                        Both Kalam and
                        Chidambaram dismissed the claims.
                        <br><br>
                        In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named the
                        <b>"Kalam-Raju
                            Stent".</b> In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in rural
                        areas, which was named the
                        <b>"Kalam-Raju Tablet".</b>
